# Active handoff: longer matched river continuation

Verified 28 September 2026, approximately 23:13 Adelaide.
The broad preflop-quality goal remains active and incomplete.

## Completed work

The two-update matched pilot and its independent readback finished successfully.
See RIVER-MATCHED-PILOT-FINDINGS.md. All eight registered comparisons are
inconclusive; no playing-strength or preflop-accuracy improvement is established.

The complete four/eight-worker control also finished successfully, exec 23567
exit 0. Do not restart that job. All checkpoints and ordered artifacts were
identical to the original update. Its paired wall times were:

- Baseline: 56.297 seconds with four workers, 55.312 with eight.
- River candidate: 247.750 seconds with four, 169.765 with eight.

The candidate used 31.5% less time (1.459x throughput) in one paired replay.
This is descriptive evidence, not a universal or statistically precise speedup.
Result: eight-worker-full-update-control-v1-result.json. Stored allocation
885,984,954 bytes, logical 2,063,708,180. No fresh test deals were used.

Commit 63fbd9cc records this result, the continuation runner/reviewer/plan and
a pure synthetic analysis control. All five committed raw files matched disk.
The synthetic control covered zero variance, a rare tail, eight contrasts,
independent scalar readback, corrupt-output rejection and wrong-count rejection.
No production code, deployment, additional GitHub push or historical deletion.

## Current live process — do not duplicate

- Exec session: **82879**.
- Python PID: **53388**; creation Unix **1790602757.6862433**.
- Command: `river_matched_continuation_v1.py --run --wait` using
  `C:/Program Files/Python312/python.exe -B`.
- Exact command, creation identity and live handle were independently verified.
- Current status: A-baseline training update 81; saved boundary 80.
- Store: `S:/GTOpen-research/weighted-complete-river-continuation-v1`.
- Status: `river-matched-continuation-v1-status.json` in this directory.
- Registration SHA256:
  `6b4b4dec4d0580d3aed5b3c2a38361eb91a58ab5dee778d929b919408ebbf14a`.
- Fresh global allocation scan passed: 721,534,139,377 bytes already allocated,
  plus 64,000,000,000 reserved, below the 800,000,000,000 global cap.

Readiness verified all frozen source dependencies, parent states and qualified
shared-query evidence. The runner and reviewer are now frozen by registration.
Do not edit them while this run is active or rewrite registered evidence.

The fixed plan continues all four parent arms 80 to 110, using eight physical
workers/four board workers. That is 120 new learning updates total. Fixed order:
A-baseline, A-river, B-river, B-baseline. The final evaluation uses 16,384 fresh
common deals, seed 9294101, full played models 0..109; model 110 is excluded.
Training and evaluation may take several hours. An invocation stops at eight
hours and preserves published boundaries; that is not a completion-time promise.
Light desktop GPU sharing, production priority and storage/memory guards remain.

The primary conservative intervals remain unchanged. A separately registered
normal approximation and tail diagnostics are exploratory only, conditional on
frozen banks; they are not finite-sample guarantees or training-seed uncertainty.
Do not select a favorable seed/seat, change the test budget from outcomes, or
promote on these results alone. See RIVER-MATCHED-CONTINUATION-PLAN.md.

## Next actions

1. Poll the existing exec handle and compact status. Verify exact process identity
   before restarting or treating missing output as failure.
2. Resume with `--run --resume --wait` only after authoritative terminal evidence.
   Preserve partial attempts; only published verified boundaries are reused.
3. After result completion and process exit, run
   `river_matched_continuation_review_v1.py --run` as a separate CPU process.
   It verifies the complete archived evaluation, checkpoints, parent continuity,
   scalar statistics, propagation snapshots and secondary tail diagnostics.
4. Report every seed/seat, uncertainty and cost. Decide whether further work on
   this river treatment is justified. Equal-time and broader stack/rake/sizing/
   multiway validation remain necessary. No broad accuracy claim is earned yet.

Original pilot handles 22398 and 13146 and worker-control handle 23567 have
all completed with exit 0. The older RIVER-MATCHED-PILOT-RUNNING.md ends with
the now-finished worker control; this document supersedes that live-job pointer.

## Follow-up preparation while the continuation trains

The same live session 82879 / PID 53388 progressed through at least 94 updates
(14 new A-baseline rounds); later progress is in the atomic status/checkpoints.
No active-study implementation, settings or analysis changed.

Commit 6ebbc93b adds river_matched_continuation_report_v1.py. After the final
independent review passes, run it with --write to produce
RIVER-MATCHED-CONTINUATION-FINDINGS.md. It authenticates the result/readback
chain and presents all eight primary and exploratory comparisons, learning cost,
preflop propagation and tail diagnostics. It refuses partial-outcome reporting.

Commit 56452604 records an isolated CPU optimization and complete evidence:
VISIBLE-FEATURE-VECTOR-FINDINGS.md and visible-features-vector-control-v1-*.json.
The CPU control handle 31141 exited 0. All 1,558,846 rows across eight immutable
parent reservoirs matched the original 302 float32 features byte for byte;
full feature preparation was 2.32-4.26x faster in one paired observation per
fixture. Synthetic card-category/invariance/invalid-input controls also passed.
The source objective/fitter copies are prepared but NOT GPU-qualified or used
in the active continuation. See that findings document for the exact next
fit-parity and complete-update checks. Do not start competing GPU work or
retrofit this runtime into the registered experiment. This is an execution
optimization, not evidence of improved poker play. No push or deployment.

## First baseline complete; candidate continuation started

Exec 82879 / PID 53388 remains live. A-baseline reached boundary 110, saving all
30 new rounds. Recorded update time totals 1,801.845 seconds; recorded competing
GPU wait totals 1.967 seconds. Checkpoint verification and orchestration add wall
time beyond the per-update metric. This is a cost observation, not an accuracy
result. The current stage is A-river update 81 (status Unix 1790605233.38394).
B-river, B-baseline, the frozen fresh evaluation and independent review remain.
The bounded monitoring exec cell 2008 completed after seeing A-baseline 110;
it was only a watcher, not a separate research process. Continue polling 82879.

Commit 68d2ad04 adds visible_features_vector_gpu_control_v1.py and
VISIBLE-FEATURE-VECTOR-GPU-PLAN.md. Read-only preflight passed all eight saved
reservoir fixtures and correctly reported the occupied research lock; no GPU
fits were started. After the active study releases GPU resources, --run will
require both original and vector fits to exactly reproduce the saved model-80
networks, scales and non-timing fit metrics, using the original seeds/settings.
A passing fit control still needs complete-update/checkpoint parity before
future adoption. Keep the currently registered experiment unchanged.

## First seed finished; second seed running

Both A-baseline and A-river reached verified checkpoint 110 (30 new rounds each).
Recorded update time totals are 1,801.845 and 5,544.326 seconds. B-river has
started; read the atomic status and progress files for its current boundary.
Main exec 82879 / PID 53388 is still the live study. Monitoring cell 2043 ended
its bounded watch; that was not the study ending. Do not wait on it again.

A small CPU-only reuse diagnostic is recorded in RIVER-QUERY-REUSE-AUDIT.md.
All 38 native exports of a fixed historical batch matched their archived bytes;
9.82% of 916,635 query rows repeated canonical visible inputs. This is not
caching performance or evidence of better poker play. The earlier four-export
audit is preserved. The full diagnostic's exec 24464 exited 0. It took 47.656
seconds on one CPU worker and overlapped live training; the result timestamps
record that overlap. No scientific sources, settings, training or evaluation
changed, and no GPU fit controls have been started. Whole-policy-query caching
is not currently a strong large-speedup lead from this one batch.

Continue the registered B-river and B-baseline arms, fresh evaluation, independent
readback and report. GPU vector-fit qualification remains queued until the main
study releases its GPU resources. No new push or deployment.

## Isolated CPU preparation candidate qualified on one archived batch

Main exec 82879 / PID 53388 remains the live continuation. Latest checked
boundary: A-baseline 110, A-river 110, B-river 87; status shows B-river update
88 in progress. B-baseline and the final evaluation/review remain outstanding.

See RIVER-QUERY-PREPARATION-FINDINGS.md. A four-export CPU profile (exec 83243,
exit 0) identified repeated validation/table scans. The new isolated
river_query_preflop_subset_v1.py applies the same tables only to preflop rows
after unchanged array/history validation and a full key/phase check.

The full fixed archived-batch control (exec 84986, exit 0) passed 38 exports,
916,635 query rows, exact prepared arrays and archived policy bytes, and twelve
invalid-input rejections. Preparation sums were 39.865 versus 21.130 seconds
(1.887x observed ratio), under concurrent study load and only one paired timing
per export. This is not full-update performance or poker-accuracy evidence.
Both helpers are finished; no new GPU task was started. Their overlap timestamps
are in their results. The current scientific sources/settings remain unchanged.

Before future adoption, qualify broader models and complete target-generation /
update equality. The separate GPU vector-fit control is still queued for after
the main study releases its GPU resources. Continue polling the same main
session; do not duplicate it. No new push or deployment.

## Downstream subset-preparation replay passed

The isolated CPU target-calculation control completed (exec 17104, exit 0).
It replayed A-river update 79 batch 00 and B-river update 80 batch 00, using
models 78 and 79. All 1,529 river target rows and all 249 output-file bytes
matched their original archives. A separate file-list/hash readback passed.
Evidence and limitations are appended to RIVER-QUERY-PREPARATION-FINDINGS.md;
control registration SHA256 is
fe5acec47b556e2c1e0962273802551a9d30cddd2c992cf98a95d1ca3352cbe9.
The candidate-only replay retained 16.12 MB and did not use GPU or new deals.

Main study session 82879 / PID 53388 is still live. Latest confirmed completed
B-river update is 91; atomic status shows update 92 running. A-baseline/A-river
remain complete at 110, and B-baseline has not started. Re-poll the same live
session for newer boundaries. No monitoring timeout is a terminal study state.

Next: finish the registered study and independent evaluation review. The
preparation candidate still needs complete-update/checkpoint equality before
adoption; the feature-vector GPU fit control also remains queued. Do not change
the running study or start competing GPU controls. No push or deployment.

## Complete-update qualification prepared, not run

Prepared training_preparation_full_update_control_v1.py and
TRAINING-PREPARATION-FULL-UPDATE-PLAN.md. Source-only preflight completed
(exec 80489, exit 0), reported the occupied research lock, and correctly listed
continuation, continuation review and GPU fit control as pending. No GPU work,
new registration, new storage directory or training replay was started.

After the matched study and independent review finish, run the existing
visible_features_vector_gpu_control_v1.py --run first. Only after all eight
saved-network/fit-metric checks pass, run
training_preparation_full_update_control_v1.py --run. It compares four complete
A-seed update-79 replays (baseline reference/candidate, river candidate/reference)
with their original saved oracle, using eight physical/four board workers.
It requires full checkpoint/restored-state/artifact and numeric-fit equality.

The candidate pipeline copies differ only in the fit-preparation import, plus
the river subset pool import. The new pool retains the original initialization
and binds subset preparation to the worker's engine instance. Original live
pipeline/worker/fitter files remain unchanged. The plan has production/GPU
priority and 12 GB plus 2 GB reserve within the global 800 GB allocated cap.
Preserve failed attempts; the queued control does not automatically retry.

Main exec 82879 / PID 53388 is still running. Latest confirmed B-river boundary
is 97 (77/120 new study updates overall); re-read actual status for current
progress. Do not start queued GPU controls while this session remains live.
No push or deployment.
